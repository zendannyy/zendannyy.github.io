### What These Posts Will Be About
I want to write articles that I feel can benefit others and give a different take on getting into the field of tech.
With the power of the internet, we can help others that are making the move or have made the move into this field
and undoubtedly have questions.

There are lots of resources and blogs for more experienced folks, and there is a lot of knowledge assumed.
These are not written with a wide demographic in mind.

Just think of the last tutorial you watched or followed. Chances are, it was either a little too “easy” or too complex. 
After “hello world” examples, people tend to optimize content for superusers.
I can’t count how many times I have gone through a tutorial
or online resource and thought “that could have been explained in the first 5 minutes”
or on the opposite end thought “where is a list of prerequisites when you need one?”

What I want to do is provide a no fluff approach in practical advice and explaining subject matter
that will serve in building technical skills in Information Security.
A lot of times we get caught up in the “next cutting edge” of technology
but it will serve us well to nail down the fundamentals.


Simply put, people might get intimidated when they only see experts discussing a subject matter.
Seeing another beginner go through the hurdles, make mistakes, and recover is very encouraging
and brings the human element back into things.
I want to see more resources tailored towards early career professionals in this field
and I have decided to do my part.
