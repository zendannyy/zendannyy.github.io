title: Skills Overview
---

In order to aid your journey to build skills for a career in tech, here is an overview of what to expect. A more in depth write up to follow.

A list of skills and qualities you need to succeed in this field  



#### Intangibles
- Persistence
- Flexibility
- Tenacity  


#### Lifelong Journey
- General Curiosity
- Feedback Hungry
- General Computer Fundamentals  


Notice how they are not necessarily hard skills and more so character traits. This is because all the technical stuff (which will become necessary) can all **[be learned](https://www.coursera.org/browse/computer-science)**. What you need is the desire to get there, and the desire to pivot onto new technologies, since these are constantly changing. Learning how to build skills is much more important.

Whether you aspire to go into Development, Information Security, (**this is what I do**) or any other domain within technology, **the ability and eagerness to learn** will be more important than any formal education.
