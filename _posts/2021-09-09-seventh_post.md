Why would one learn Linux in the first place?

### Introductory Post on Linux 

Why would one learn Linux in the first place?
Besides being more secure by design, it puts the user in the driver seat. As much customization or little as you would like. Also for cloud computing, Linux is heavily used. 

Here are some basic commands that are often used. If you learn these well, you will be on your way.
cd, ls, mkdir, man, pwd, last

Most of these are for general maneuvering around the filesystem. You can think of each listed command as the following.


#### **Where am I?**
pwd, ls, ls -lah

#### **Where to?**
cd, cd ..

#### **Who is logged in?**
last

#### ** How do I use this? **
man cd, man last, etc.

The goal is to get you up and running in Linux and know where to look for help. As no one knows everything. However, the best people simply just know where to look. Oftentimes a google search for a command will take you to the actual man page for it, where you can do this yourself from your terminal or command prompt. 
(man cd, man last, etc.)
