This is a continuation of the post
Why would one learn Linux in the first place?

### Get setup with Linux 
Setup instructions
 
Please install the following
 
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
 
[Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Vagrant uses a base image to quickly clone a virtual machine, and saves time and resources in the
installation process. This is faster than setting up a virtual machine manually through a virtual box 
 
 
Virtualbox is the virtualization software that we will use, it is free and platform agnostic.

Once you get output with the following command, you have a successful installation
 
vagrant -h
![vagrant -h](/images/vagrant_h.png)


I like Vagrant for its catalog of box OSes. It's also fairly fast and much more performant than using a local VM on your host machine.
