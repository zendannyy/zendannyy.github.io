title: Intro to Linux Course
---

I have talked about the areas that are important when it comes to learning about Security. Although there are several, (more that can be covered in one post) here are a few that stand out are the following.
<br>

* Network Fundamentals
* OS Fundamentals (Any OS)
* Learning Linux

Recently, I have been heads down working on making an Intro to Linux Course.

If you’re going to be working with servers in your career, chances are they will be running Linux. If you find yourself in a Cloud environment, chances are this is going to be in Linux. Learning this skill will be a difference maker for you.
I really hope the community will find value in the course and get the most out of it.
I have taken from my experience working in Security and am putting together this intro course. 

I truly believe if resources are readily available to people that are just starting out, this can be the catalyst they need to keep going on their journey.

Here is an overview of what I’m preparing
