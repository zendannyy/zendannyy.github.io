title: Intro to Linux Course Available
---

When people ask me what they should learn for Cybsersecurity, I usually recommend learning Linux.  In Cybersecurity and in any Cloud environment, there is a high chance you will be working on Linux.
I mentioned previously that I was working on an introductory course and would make it available to the community. 

I am glad to be able to say that the course is here.

I have made it so anyone not familiar with the Linux command line can get started and learn right away. It also comes with resources to be able to fully replicate the install shown. I have definitely taken courses or tutorials before where I’m left thinking to myself “where is a list of requirements to follow along?”. I strived for a reproducible environment that will allow you to follow along and avoid this issue. 
All the necessary information to get going is in the “Resources” tabs within the course.

Any feedback is welcome as I believe in an iterative process to get the best product out.
