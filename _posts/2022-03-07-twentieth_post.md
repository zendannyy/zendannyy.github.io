## Cybersecurity Career Paths: Blue Team Deep Dive

This will be part of a 4 part series where we'll discuss career paths and roles within Cybersecurity in more depth. 

Blue Team is the “defense” of Cybersecurity, those who defend and protect data and digital resources.  Job families within the Blue Team can be: Incident Response, Detection and Response, Threat Intel, Threat Hunting, Application Security, Compliance.

I previously had a post which discussed an [overview] (https://zendannyy.github.io/sixth_post/) of the field of Cybersecurity. This will help seeing the how the Blue Team fits into the big picture.

This is not an exhaustive list(In case you see slightly different ones), however it covers the main job families that others are derived from. As an example, Malware Analysis can be derived from Incident Response. Security Architecture can be derived from Application Security, and so forth.

Each of these job families could have a post of their own. I plan on doing a deep dive on each of these to shed more light on what it could look like on the inside.
