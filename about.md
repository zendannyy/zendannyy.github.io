From utility work to Cybersecurity, I was able to make the career change and want to help as many people as possible to get into the field as well. This starts with learning about the intricacies of the field as well as the hard skills.  
<br>

During my move to Security I recognized the odds were stacked. To put things in perspective, I had done a couple of years of community college and no degree. Everything I knew I had learned either on my own or was learning on the job (internship). I knew I was competing with graduates from Ivy League schools and experience at a whoâ€™s who of other top companies. I even had left my job in Electrical Utility(completely different) to focus on this opportunity.

What I wanted was to get my foot in the door. I knew if I could prove my character as a person as well as my ability to learn on the spot, I had a shot. So I went for it.
